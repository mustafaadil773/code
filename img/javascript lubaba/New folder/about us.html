        <h2>🌸 Our Story</h2>
        <p>At <strong>Ruqayah luxe</strong>, our journey began with a simple dream: to craft abayas that blend
          deep-rooted tradition with contemporary sophistication. What started as a passion for modest fashion has grown
          into a label dedicated to celebrating the confident, graceful woman in every season of life.</p>

        <h2>✨ Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We believe that modesty is timeless. Each collection is designed to honor cultural values while embracing
          modern silhouettes and refined details. Our pieces are intended to be worn with pride — expressing identity,
          faith and style simultaneously.</p>

        <h2>🧵 Craftsmanship & Quality</h2>
        <p>Quality is at the heart of everything we do. We source premium fabrics and use careful tailoring to ensure
          comfort, durability, and effortless drape. From subtle finishes to thoughtful linings, every abaya reflects
          our commitment to excellence.</p>
